# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
### I wanted to clean the dataset well enough to be able to extract the necessary data to answer the questions provided as well as the ones I came up with.

## Process
### 1. Review tasks and determine which columns were required and needed to be cleaned for the tasks. 
### 2. Make temporary tables with necessary data 
### 3. Begin cleaning by converting columns to proper datatypes, making changes to the columns by replacing or removing missing values, and dividing up columns to make it easier to access later on.  

## Results
### I discovered this data can allow me to access which products and product categories are mostly ordered, which countries/cities bring in the most revenue. 

## Challenges 
### I found it was very difficult to analyze the data properly since a lot of relevant data was missing. There was also a lack of unique values regarding products and their skus. 

## Future Goals
### If I had more time, I would clean the data up a lot better. I would also do my best to normalize all of the data involving the products.
