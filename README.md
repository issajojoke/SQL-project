# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
### I wanted to clean the dataset well enough to be able to adequately extract the data I needed to answer the questions provided as well as the ones I came up with.

## Process
### 1. Review tasks and determine which columns were required and needed to be cleaned for the tasks. 
### 2. Make temporary tables with necessary data 
### 3. Begin cleaning by converting columns to proper datatypes, making changes to to the columns by replacing missing values, and dividing up columns to make it easier to access later on.  

## Results
### I discovered this data can allow me to access which products and product categories are mostly ordered, which countries/cities bring in the most revenue. It also provided a lot of information about how much time was spent on the website as well as how many site visits it received per country/city. 

## Challenges 
### I found it was very difficult to analyze the data properly since a lot of relevant data was missing. There was also a lack of unique values regarding products and their skus.

## Future Goals
### If I had more time, I would clean the data up a lot better. I would have done my best to normalize all of the data involving the products. Additionally, I would have studied the dataset a bit more to understand how the tables related to eachother and why the columns were split up the way they were.
